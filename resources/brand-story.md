# Brand Story

**Visual Python** is an open source project started for students who struggle with coding during Python classes for data science.

Just as the sun rises and the vision brighten, Visual Python is designed with the concept of giving hope and bright energy to people who are struggling with coding Python.

Inspired by the rising sun, bright orange and yellow gradation colors are used for the logo.
